# Software Development & Front-End Design Project

The following exercise is used to gauge your abilities in programming and problem solving. These tasks were carefully designed to reflect some of the responsibilities you may face over the course of the internship. Please spend **no more than 90 minutes** on this project and be prepared to discuss your work during the technical interview. Once you have completed the tasks below or reached the 90 minute time limit, please email your work to Tim and Jai. Feel free to reach out with any clarifying questions. Best of luck!

## Please complete the following tasks:
 
- Describe the difference between a JavaScript library and a JavaScript framework. Provide examples of each and a brief description of the functionality they provide.
- Using the "index.html" file, create a table similar to the one pictured in the "Multiplication Grid.png" image. You should write a JavaScript function that takes the user inputs for X- and Y-Depth and outputs an HTML table with that number of columns and rows, respectively. The background colors of the cells should be determined by which quartile the cell's value is in compared to the maximum value in the table.
- Write a development plan for how you might adapt this web page to achieve the following additional requirements:
    - Instead of using user input data, the page makes an API request which returns the results of the "table-specifications.json" and builds several multiplication tables on the same page.
    - The page must look nice and work on a variety of screen sizes, even when the table is very large.
    - Allow the user to click and drag the tables and then save the order so it is maintained when the page refreshes.
